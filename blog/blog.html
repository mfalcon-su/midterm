        <h1>Getting Zero Wasted at the 2017 Tessier Family Reunion</h1>
        <p>Family reunions. A dish best served with a case of beer, a bottle of wine, and a glass of kookamunga juice - at least that’s how we do it on the Tessier side. Each year at Oakledge Park in Burlington, Vermont my mom’s side of the family reunites for the annual Tessier Reunion - a gathering that has never once been missing laughter, my mom’s ear-piercing whistle to quiet the crowd, or alcohol. However, this year we offered the suggestion of getting a different type of wasted. Zero-wasted. The idea to take an environmentally conscious spin on our annual celebration occurred to me while studying abroad in Rome, Italy this past summer. I was shocked to see how much waste covered the city on almost any given day. It littered the floors of market places, piled high on street corners, was scattered around famous fountains after breaking through plastic bag holders, and even decorated Via Germanico, the street I lived on where a one ton dumpster stayed flipped over - all seemingly invisible to most of the tourists and city dwellers who walked by. Yet, this was our doing. I watched countless times as people pushed Forno pizza slice wrappers into trash bags that were well over capacity. My most prominent recollection of these waves of waste being after Thursday and Friday nights when the streets of Trestevere were covered in plastic cups and straws from the night before - melting into cracks of the cobblestone heated by the morning sun. Not only recycles, but perfectly good food too - including fresh fruits and vegetables, were carelessly discarded. It turned out to be the perfect setting to study food waste. Similar to oil seeping into the ocean from a nearby spill, it was as if no path was safe from the mindless appetites and garbage producing habits of tourists and natives alike.</p>

            <h1>Vegan in Rome - Summer 2017 Abroad</h1>
            <p>With the first two weeks in Roma being celebrated by indulging in all (vegan) things pizza and pasta related, yesterday I felt like I could physically hear my stomach begging to digest something green. Fate be it, a wrong turn on my way to class lead me to the home of all things raw, organic, and green, Écru Art Gallery & Raw Food. The entrance and interior filled with unique art pieces, books, and beautiful plants of all varieties and sizes made the sounds of whooshing buses and cyclists flying by the only reminder that I was still in the heart of Rome’s historical centre. As both a tourist and student abroad, saving money by selecting lunch specials has become a necessary yet enjoyable task. At Ècru, the 10€ lunch special, which includes the choice of a sandwich, crackers with cream, an expresso, and a filtered water, does just the trick. As a starter, the tzatziki with cashew yogurt and almond crackers to dip in was even better than it sounded. The perfect amount of dill and lemon juice provided a fresh taste and the nuttiness of the almond cracker fused perfectly. Then was the caper cream, avocado, caramelized red onions, and salad sandwich on homemade raw bread. The creamy spread of the caper sauce and avocado paired with the sweetness of the caramelized onions made for a simple yet savory dish, especially when placed between the grainy texture of two homemade pieces of raw bread. So, whether you’re a raw vegan organic health food guru, or you’re just looking for some extra fiber in your meal, be sure to check out Écru Art Gallery & Raw Foods @ Via Acciaioli, 13!</p>
