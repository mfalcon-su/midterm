        <h2>WE BELIEVE</h2>
        <p>that the key to a successful life is more important than just</p>
        <p>healthy eating and looking good. It’s about feeling the best you</p>
        <p>can while doing your best for the life around you. It’s about</p>
        <p>having strong relationships with the people surrounding you and </p>
        <p>the worlds both inside and out. It means treating animals,</p> 
        <p>Mother Nature, and our bodies with the respect they deserve.</p>
        <p>It means being conscious about what we consume, how our daily </p>
        <p>choices affect the Earth, and how, with a clear mind, we can grow </p>
        <p>and become one with the boss ladies inside us all.</p>
        <h3>We are striving for a sustainable future through food, </h3>
        <h3>compassion, community, shared ideas, and non conformity.</h3>
